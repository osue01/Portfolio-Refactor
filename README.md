# React + Vite

The purpose of this challenge was to refactor our portofolio using react. We were meant to breakdown our original portfolio into components and rebuild into a single page application.

One of the challenges of having a portfolio as a single page application that I discussed with Wesley CLements is that refreshing components on a single page will limit your SEO. Since the content of my project page is not loaded until requested, a bot scanning for similar projects may skip over mine. Something to consider!

Thanks for Wesley Clements for helping me with this one!
